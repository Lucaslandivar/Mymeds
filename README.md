<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>My mother became my first client, she told me that she needed help with accounting for expenses and administering the medicines that my grandfather must take every day. Since he takes more than 18 meds a day, my mom has trouble administering and managing his med consumption. She asked me to carry out a project to help with this issue, I made an excel spreadsheet to help her, but then I decided to make a website to, in the future, help more people with the same problem. I made this project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where I managed to delve into HTML and CSS in terms of flexbox and display, and implemented JavaScript to learn more and more. Thank you for viewing the project and any comments are very helpful to improve the project!</p>
